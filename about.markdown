It always felt awkward to right about myself in the third person, so I'll just keep this as informal as possible. My name is Dakota. No "About" page is ever going to truly capture my essence, let alone who I am.

So, for now I'll just tell you that I am:

- constantly questioning my understanding of the world around me.
- routinely fucking with technology of any/all sorts.
- enamored with emersive games and great storytelling.

If you ask my politics, I'm inclined not to answer. Instead, I will only disclose that I believe in the posibility of a world that is equitable for all, but I also know it will require the kind of collective ego-death that only occurs amidst many cultural revolutions...

And since everyone seems to have their own idea of what revolution looks like, I'm simply starting with the things that I can do and not getting hung up on the details. Anything more than that, you'll just have to read about or ask me.

Regards,<br/>
Dakota
